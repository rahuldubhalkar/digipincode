      "question": "How do I perform an India PIN code search?",

Alternatively, on the home page, you can search Indian post offices by state and district to find the correct PIN code for any location. This is the most comprehensive postal code finder online."

Our tool provides details for all types, from a major G.P.O. to the smallest branch office."
    },
    "q6": {

    "q7": {
      "question": "How do I find post office details using a PIN code?",
